it's the home of Uncle Lem Who was born and raised and lived there ninety years There's not a boy in this ole' town That had'nt stopped for water at his well Or sat on his porch in the evening And listened to the stories that he'd tell His hair was the color of cotton fields And his skin was old and brown And he was born in that rundown shack Before there was a town He bought that shack and piece of earth For the highest price you'd pay His Mom was bought and sold there Uncle Lem was born a slave undefined The mayor and some ladies of the Garden Club went out to that old shack To tell Uncle Lem that he'd have to find another place to live But they found him there in that old broken down rocking chair and on an Old brown paper sack they found his will.

that you're not getting wet That's the only way on earth I have for knowing how you're doing When you left you said you call but you ain't yet And I think I was better off when I was hungry And fighting off the wolfs from our front door But I wrote this song and it came on strong and left you once too often Now I think I was better off when I was hungry My guitar brought us here to Bonmat Texas And I bought you everything your eyes could see But the mansion couldn't hold you could nobody's arms to warm you I guess I gave you everything but me Slowly the long day turns to night And soon they'll turn out the prison lights But in my cell I'm making plans To be with you at home again These walls and bars can't hold a dreaming man So I'll be home to tuck the babies in They can chain my body but not my mind And I'll break out again tonight The warden thinks I'm in for life 'Cause all he's ever seen me wear is stripes He don't know bout my blue suit and my tie That I wear when I'm with you each night And I'll break out again tonight The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue The iron curtain falls on this cold war with you 'Cause you won't speak and I won't speak, it's true Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through undefined Why, oh why, should love ever come to couples, like you and me Whose cold, cold wars are never done and whose hearts just can't be free So let's make up or let's just say we're through I just can't stand another cold, cold war with you I just can't stand another cold, cold war with you Ladies of the Garden Club say His home is just a disgrace to the town If the mayor wants re-elected He'd better pass some laws and tear it down They want to cover it with flowers Maybe even plant some Dogwood trees I guess that they've forgotten when we were kids What that place used to be I know it's just a shanty now But Lord that place was built with human tears For it's the home of Uncle Lem Who was born and raised and lived there ninety years There's not a boy in this ole' town That had'nt stopped for water at his well Or sat on his porch in the evening And listened to the stories that he'd tell His hair was the color of cotton fields And his skin was old and brown And he was born in that rundown shack Before there was a town He bought that shack and piece of earth For the highest price you'd pay His Mom was bought and sold there Uncle Lem was born a slave undefined The mayor and some ladies of the Garden Club went out to that old shack To tell Uncle Lem that he'd have to find another place to live But they found him there in that old broken down rocking chair and on an Old brown paper sack they found his will. Now I wanna leave my old Shotgun to the fine mayor of this town for I remember when he was just A little fella' he used to follow me around. Lord, I wish I had more to Leave to my friends that I love, but, Lord, all I've got's this old shack and Piece of earth and I want it to go to the ladies of the Garden Club His Mom was bought and sold

yesterday But when someone tempted you you ease to cross the line And I'll bet love and honor never cross your mind You're the woman that once gave me her hand And I'm the fool who's trying hard to

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer Had a very shiny nose And if you ever saw him You would even say it glows All of the other reindeer Used to laugh and call him names They never let poor Rudolph Join in any reindeer games Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say:  Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? Then all the reindeer loved him As they shouted out with glee Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer You'll go down in history!

Standing right in front of me Was a little boy waiting anxiously Pacing 'round like little boys do And in his hands he held a pair of shoes And his clothes were worn and old He was dirty from head to toe And when it came his time to pay I couldn't believe what I heard him say Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time You see, she's been sick for quite awhile And I know these shoes would make her smile And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight He counted pennies for what seemed like years Then the Cashier said,  He searched his pockets frantically Then he turned and he looked at me He said,  Though most years she just did without  Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said  Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please It's

her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love As he thanked me and ran out I knew that God had sent that little boy To remind me, what Christmas is all about Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time You see, she's been sick for quite

Trying to buy that last gift or two Not really in the Christmas mood Standing right in front of me Was a little boy waiting anxiously Pacing 'round like little boys do And in his hands he held a pair of shoes And his clothes were worn and old He was dirty from head to toe And when it came his time to pay I couldn't believe what I heard him say Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time You see, she's been sick for quite awhile And I know these shoes would make her smile And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight He counted pennies for what seemed like years Then the Cashier said,  He searched his pockets frantically Then he turned and he looked at me He said,  Though most years she just did without  Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said  Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time You see, she's been sick for quite awhile And I know these shoes would make her smile And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love As he thanked me and ran out I knew that God had sent that little boy To remind me, what Christmas is all about Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time You see, she's been sick for quite awhile And I know these shoes would make her smile And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight And I want her to
